# Honeypot Project

## Introduction
This project implements a **honeypot** system designed for detecting and logging attacks in a safe environment. A honeypot is a decoy system that imitates a real system to attract attackers. The goal is to monitor malicious activities and gain insights into attack techniques.

## How It Works
- The honeypot mimics a real web server and captures unauthorized access attempts.
- It uses **Flask**, a lightweight Python framework, to serve HTTP requests.
- Attacks such as **SQL injection**, **brute force**, and **cross-site scripting (XSS)** are lackers.

## How to Run the Projectogged along with the attacker's IP address.
- The honeypot writes attack data to log files for further analysis.

## Features
- **Capture POST requests**: The honeypot captures any POST requests made to its `/login` endpoint.
- **Logging**: Attack details such as the attackerâ€™s IP address, attempted username, and password are logged.
- **Fake Responses**: It mimics a real server by returning fake login failures to trick att
